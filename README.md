# WeThinkRobots

A space to explore ideas around an imagined platform for teaching/learning programming, objects-first.

Right now nothing more than [a wiki](https://github.com/mikro2nd/wethinkrobots/wiki).

*If you know of a better place than the MS-infested GH to host a **simple** wiki (preferably with automatic backlinks)
please let [me](https://github.com/mikro2nd) know.*
